# Devops Project
DevOps Project
Private's logbook, Stardate 100164.62

The goal of this project/lab is to share and registers the basic knowledge necessary to construct an IaC (Infrastructure as Code).

You need to have in mind that if you want to work as a DevOps engenniner or SRE, that's the minimum knowledge required to apply for opportunities in Brazil for the following levels:

- Junior
- Mid-level

In some companies, you'll be able to the Junior and others maybe Mid Level with this kind of knowledge shown in the following sections. At the present date.

I'm gonna share the basic knowledge of DevOps field, as a way for presentation for Recruiters, Headhunters, etc and a method for self-learning/improvement.

If someone on the Internet drop at this repository or Blog, please take your notes if you like something feels free to use it. But the main focus is to find a quick way to show, register and study this field of I.T.

I'm not gonna focus on theory, or detailed explanation of topics. If you're thinking of using this Repo/Blog don't wait here for this type of information, there are tons of excellent material to learn in detail and depth about any topic shown here on the Internet.

So, that's the brief and goal of this repository, which I'll use only for personal purposes. But feel free to copy and use it as an introductory guide to DevOps, if you see any value in the content as already mentioned.

I.T. Infrastructure Enthusiast in general.
